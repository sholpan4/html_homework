                            I hit the sack<br>
                            I've been too long, I'm glad to be back<br>
                            Yes, I'm let loose<br>
                            From the noose<br>
                            That's kept me hanging about<br>
                            I've been looking at the sky<br>
                            'Cause it's gettin' me high<br>
                            Forget the hearse 'cause I never die<br>
                            I got nine lives<br>
                            Cat's eyes<br>
                            Abusin' every one of them and running wild<br>
                            'Cause I'm back<br>
                            Yes, I'm back<br>
                            Well, I'm back<br>

                            Well, I'm back, back<br>
                            Well, I'm back in black<br>
                            Yes, I'm back in black<br>
                            Back in the back<br>
                            Of a Cadillac<br>
                            Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack<br>
                            Yes, I'm in a bang<br>
                            With a gang<br>
                            They've got to catch me if they want me to hang<br>
                            'Cause I'm back on the track<br>
                            And I'm beatin' the flack<br>
                            Nobody's gonna get me on another rap<br>
                            So look at me now<br>
                            I'm just makin' my play<br>
                            Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way<br>
                            'Cause I'm back<br>
                            Yes, I'm back<br>

                            I remembered black skies<br>
                            The lightning all around me<br>
                            I remembered each flash<br>
                            As time began to blur<br>
                            Like a startling sign<br>
                            That fate had finally found me<br>
                            And your voice was all I heard<br>
                            That I get what I deserve<br>
                            So give me reason<br>
                            To prove me wrong<br>
                            To wash this memory clean<br>
                            Let the floods cross<br>
                            The distance in your eyes<br>
                            Give me reason<br>
                            To fill this hole<br>

                            Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies<br>
                            Across this new divide<br>
                            There was nothing in sight<br>
                            But memories left abandoned<br>
                            There was nowhere to hide<br>
                            The ashes fell like snow<br>
                            And the ground caved in<br>
                            Between where we were standing<br>
                            And your voice was all I heard<br>
                            That I get what I deserve<br>
                            So give me reason<br>

                            Let the floods cross<br>
                            The distance in your eyes<br>
                            Across this new divide<br>
                            In every loss, in every lie<br>
                            In every truth that you'd deny<br>
                            And each regret, and each goodbye<br>
                            Was a mistake too great to hide<br>
                            And your voice was all I heard<br>
                            That I get what I deserve<br>
